# What is this?
Umaro is a 2D frame animation editor mostly oriented for pixel-art artists and game developers.

At this moment it's a **working prototype** with basic functions, like importing images and animation data (XML/plain text), adding/editing/removing animations and their frames and basic UI cues.

# What can I do with this editor?
You can **create, modify and preview animations** and then **export them** in desired format for later use in your game/app.

A tutorial on importing created animations in your game/app is avalaible on the corresponding Wiki page.

# What I cannot do with this editor?
* Create a spritesheet from the scratch - use an external graphics editor (like PyxelEdit) for this.
* Automagically create an animation frames and transitions - these must be done by hand in a graphics editor or some other app, and then imported as image in Umaro.

# Why Umaro?
This app is named after yeti from Final Fantasy series - because yetis are cool.
